# OVERVODKA — Dota 2 Custom Game

**OVERVODKA** is a popular custom game that reimagines Dota 2 with an off-meta sandbox where streamers, meme icons and characters from cult animation share one map. Expect bold design, fast patches, and a lot of personality—without sacrificing playability.

> Built with **Lua** and **JavaScript** using **Dota 2 Workshop Tools** (Source 2).

## Key Features
- **Unique Heroes:** Play dozens of well-known media characters, each with **fully reworked ability kits**.
- **High-Impact Gameplay:** New **items, events, and mechanics** that challenge standard Dota expectations.
- **Ongoing Updates:** We **regularly add heroes and items** and iterate on balance so the meta stays fresh.

## What’s in this Repo
Scripts (Lua), KV configs, particles/VFX, sound events, UI/tooltip files, and other assets that power the mod.

---

## Collaboration
I’m open to proposals for co-development (scripting, design, VFX/SFX, UI, localization, testing).  
Open an **Issue** or submit a **PR** with clear scope and goals.
